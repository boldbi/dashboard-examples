## About Bold BI's Embed Sandbox
The Embed Sandbox is an evaluation playground that allows you to explore Bold BI dashboards and their concepts within an embedding environment. It offers a hands-on opportunity to understand how integration can enhance data visualization and decision-making processes in real-world applications. 
Key features of the Embed Sandbox include dashboard management, data source management, and user permissions. When you [sign up for the tria](https://app.boldid.net/bi/embedded/register?plan=192&evaluation=v2) in Bold BI, we create a user account using your email ID and provide you with 5 default dashboards and 7 sample data sources to explore.
